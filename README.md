# Word-Hunt-Solver

This short personal project takes in a grid from GamePigeon's Word Hunt game and finds the longest words to maximize your score. For more information about this project, please visit my website:

Project Overview:
This project has two main files:
- FastSolver.py: This contains the code needed to run the project. It makes a call to Visualizer.py once the grid is filled out. Press enter to submit/validate the values added to the grid. 
- Visualizer.py: Generates a grid and marks the strokes needed to get a particular word. To move between each word, use the left and right arrows on your keyboard.

Archive Files:
- SolverOG.py: This file uses deepcopies of 2D arrays to generate each word. This turned out to be far too slow, which is why I moved to a string-based approach in FasterSolver.py
